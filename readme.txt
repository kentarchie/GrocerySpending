This was originally a web application built using Apache httpd, PHP and MySQL.
this project is to convert it to node.js and Mongo.
The first commit has the basic structure and the start ofthe Mongo interface.
The database directory contains two json files that have initial data for the tables.
The web applivcation won't be published for geneal use.

After the web application is converted, I will build an Android app to do the same stuff.
The Android app will keep the data locally on the device.
